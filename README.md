# Average-Book-Ratings-Prediction
This project uses linear regression to predict average book ratings for users in 2018.

The aim of this project is to predict what readers will rate the books that a certain company will publish in 2018. We have the data from 2017, where we know what readers read and what rating each user provided on average to all books they read. So, I will use linear regression to predict the average rating for books in 2018, which will be using the books read in 2017 + books that will be read in 2018.

The Dataset used for this project can be found in this repository and it is called "User Data.csv" and the steps taken to predict the average rating can be found in this repository as well as in my website:
